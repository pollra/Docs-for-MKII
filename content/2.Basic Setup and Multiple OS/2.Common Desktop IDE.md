# Common Desktop IDE

# Introduction

**For software developers,** we listed some common IDE below, so you can build your desktop development environment easily! 

More importantly, if you are interested in **IoT**, you could **control the physical world** and **get the sensor data** easily by Arduino **in different types of programming languages**.

Enjoy Coding! Enjoy IoT!

# Common IDE

##Arduino IDE ( For IoT )
