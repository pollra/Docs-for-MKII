# Introduction

Here's the world's first hackable computer. An Ultimate Single-Board Computer for your Big Idea.

The Docs is broken down into three parts:

- [Getting started your LattePanda]( ). The very first start to show you how to power on device.

- [Multiple OS and Desktop IDE]( ). Download the different OS there. 

  **For software developer**, we provide the **tutorial on controlling the physical world** and **getting the sensor value** in **different programming language(C#, Java, Python, etc.)** Welcome to **IoT**!

- [Hardware & Playability]( ). We will show you the Pinout Diagram. There are so many interface on the board, we will simply show you the usage of these interface.

First, Let me introduce the new generation product— LattePanda Alpha/Delta for you.

## Design concept

### Alpha Edition

Generally refers to the leader in a wolf pack, α / Alpha. It will also be the leader in the LattePanda series, the most powerful in performance. Known as the leader of the Pandas, or "AlphaPanda" for short.

The Alpha Edition uses the same Intel 7th generation Core m3 processor as the latest MacBook. The Core m3 processor is the perfect choice for superior performance and low power consumption.

A LattePanda also includes an integrated Arduino compatible co-processor, which means it can be used to control and sense the physical world! Whether you are a Windows developer, IoT developer, DIY fanatic, interactive designer, robotics whizz, or maker, a LattePanda single board computer can aid your creative process! 

###Delta Edition

Mathematical Character △; a triangle. In terms of product design, performance, price and power consumption, it signals a compromise between the three. It keeps the perfect balancing. Balancing is always the best and reflects the beauty of engineering.

The Delta Edition uses an Intel 8th generation Celeron N4100 processor. This Celeron processor is the perfect choice for features and price as a main robotics controller, interactive project core, IoT edge device or AI brain. So LattePanda Delta is still x86 based SBC design.

##Supported Operating Systems

###Windows
