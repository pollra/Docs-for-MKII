# Display configuration

Which display cable you wanna use? Let me show you how to connect your display!

## HDMI

Connect the monitor cable to the LattePanda's HDMI port. Make sure that your monitor is turned on. It won't display anything until you power on the device.

## eDP

**Note:Please connect FPC wire with LattePanda BEFORE you turn the power-on. And make sure the Golden Finger face the right side. The contacts on FPC are very compact and in order. Please be careful that any dislocation connection may cause the LattePanda short circuit and the IPS display behave abnormal like ghosting or flicker.**

##DP/ DVI/ VGA

You need a Type-c to (DP/ DVI /VGA) adapter so that you can connect your display with DP cable.



##Multi-display

If you connect more than 2 displays, LattePanda will automatically detect it and expand the screen.
