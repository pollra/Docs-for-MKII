## M.2 Interface

On the board, we set two M.2 interfaces (One E key, one B & M key) which can connect M.2 2280 module (2280 denotes a module 22 mm wide and 80 mm long).

##USB 3.0 Interface

This is the most common interface. But all of them are USB 3.0 which means the speed of transfer data up to 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s), 10 times faster than the USB 2.0 standard! Due to the high transmission speed, LattePanda can connect more accessories such as RealSense camera and VR.

##USB-C Interface

We have a USB-C interface on the board, formally known as **USB Type-C**. It can be used as a 12V power Input or use a USB-C hub to expend more interface like DP, DVI, SD card socket, etc.

## RS232

The RS-232 standard had been commonly used in computer serial ports. Thanks to their simplicity and past ubiquity, It is also used—particularly in industrial machines, networking equipment, and scientific instruments where a short-range, point-to-point, low-speed wired data connection is required.
